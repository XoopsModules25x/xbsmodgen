Release Notes for XBS Modgen module. V1.0
-----------------------------------------

Installation instructions
-------------------------

1/ Install XBS CDM (Code Data Management) module first.  You can find this module at the same place as you found this one.
2/ Install this module (XBS ModGen) as per normal Xoops module installation

Known limitations/problems
--------------------------
File ownership: all files are created under the ownership of the username running your web server and are therefore owned by that user.  However, editable files are saved with a file mode of 0646 (i.e. world writeable) so you can edit them.  Prior to sending out your module to the wider world, you will need to change these permissions to 0644 (owner writeable) and change the file ownership to yourself.

Regenerating a module will overwrite existing files

You still need to a/ think about your module first and b/ write the logic for your own application.  Come on, you want me to write that as well? :-)

Future development
